# Retail Sales Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project focuses on visualizing retail sales data using **Power BI Web**.
The dashboard is built on top of a previously completed **SQL data analysis project**, where the data was explored, cleaned, and analyzed using PostgreSQL.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how **SQL-based insights** can be transformed into **clear and interactive visual analytics** using Power BI.

> **SQL Analysis → Power BI Visualization**
